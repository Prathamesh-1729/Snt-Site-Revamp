      <description>The Electromyography (EMG) controlled shooting game is an exciting blend of neurophysiology, gaming technology, and human-computer interaction. By utilizing the electrical signals produced by muscle activity, EMG technology allows players to control game actions through their muscle movements. This innovative approach not only offers a unique and immersive gaming experience but also holds great potential for applications in rehabilitation and assistive technologies.**In our game, EMG sensors detect the subtle electrical signals produced during muscle contractions. These signals are then translated into precise and responsive in-game actions, offering players an unparalleled level of control. The game is developed using Unity, a popular and user-friendly game development platform.**The final outcome of our project is a real-time system that allows users to control a Unity-based shooting game using their muscle activity. The EMG sensors capture muscle signals, which are processed and transmitted by a Python script and TCP server. Unity then retrieves this processed data to control game elements, creating an interactive and immersive gaming experience.</description>
