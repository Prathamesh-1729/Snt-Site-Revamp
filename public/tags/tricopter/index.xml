      <description>A tricopter is a three-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle. It consists of a lightweight frame, brushless motors, ESCs, a flight controller, a battery, and servos. Used primarily for educational purposes, such as learning aerodynamics and electronics, it also serves in surveillance and recreational flying. Key components include a frame, propeller, tail rotor, and power distribution board. The ground control is managed by Mission Planner, with Ardupilot as the firmware.</description>
