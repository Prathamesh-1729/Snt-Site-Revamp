      <description>Our aim is to advance aerial autonomy by building autonomous UAVs. We are focused on developing open-source UAV solutions for real-world challenges. Since our start in 2017 we have represented IIT Kanpur at top competitions, including a global top-10 finish at IMAV 2019 and five consecutive podiums at the Inter IIT Tech Meet. Most recently, the team participated in ICUAS, securing the 3rd place globally.</description>
