      <description>The acrobatic plane, constructed from lightweight balsa wood, offers the capability for complex maneuvers such as loops, inverted flight, and vertical stands. It features a symmetric airfoil with S8035 profile wings, while the elevator and rudder utilize the NACA0012 profile. Laser cutting creates precise shapes for the components. The wings span 1.5 meters with a chord length of 31 cm, divided into two symmetrical sections, each fabricated separately. Ailerons, each 6 cm wide, are cut from the wings. The propulsion system comprises a 580kV Propdrive brushless DC motor, four servos, a 14.8 V 4S 4200 mAh LiPo battery, a 100 Amp electronic speed controller (ESC), and a six-channel receiver.</description>

      <description>We’ve developed an electronic drum kit with an interface consisting of two drumsticks, each equipped with an Inertial Measurement Unit sensor. The traditional drum pads or any striking surface are omitted. When a drumstick downstroke is detected, drum sounds purely synthesized by the pygame will be played. The drum kit features six types of sounds—hi-hat, snare, hi-toms, crash, lo-toms, ride. Fundamentally, the project comprises of these core layers that require integration- fabrication of drumsticks, drumstick motion sensing, master and peripheral device communication via Bluetooth, audio synthesis program and a frontend for the application to allow for user inputs. As extension goals, we plan on allowing some way for users to give inputs for the kick drum, but for now we plan on focusing on the snare drums, cymbals and the tom-tom drums. As a result of this device, we hope to decrease the noise created by an actual drum-kit, increase the portability and completely eliminate the set up time.</description>

      <description>The Electromyography (EMG) controlled shooting game is an exciting blend of neurophysiology, gaming technology, and human-computer interaction. By utilizing the electrical signals produced by muscle activity, EMG technology allows players to control game actions through their muscle movements. This innovative approach not only offers a unique and immersive gaming experience but also holds great potential for applications in rehabilitation and assistive technologies.**In our game, EMG sensors detect the subtle electrical signals produced during muscle contractions. These signals are then translated into precise and responsive in-game actions, offering players an unparalleled level of control. The game is developed using Unity, a popular and user-friendly game development platform.**The final outcome of our project is a real-time system that allows users to control a Unity-based shooting game using their muscle activity. The EMG sensors capture muscle signals, which are processed and transmitted by a Python script and TCP server. Unity then retrieves this processed data to control game elements, creating an interactive and immersive gaming experience.</description>

Project started from very basic and touched advanced tech aspect for detection of constellations in night sky and detection of habitable exoplanets for future human endeavors through ESI.*Project covered theoretical astronomy, observational astronomy, and application of ML modelling to achieve final goal. Mapping the cosmos for constellation detection and learning contribution to the journey of Interstellar quest for survival by detecting habitable exoplanets served our two main objectives of the project which consecutively acted as path to reach the final goal.&lt;em&gt;Constellation detector model&lt;/em&gt;The first objective of project focused on learning about Constellations and developing ML model telling names of constellation present in any image by blending astronomy with fundamentals of image processing and ML. We worked with northen sky constellations.&lt;em&gt;Earth similarity detector model&lt;/em&gt;Once we have mapped cosmos, we moved on to find our potential homes in fine corners of this cosmos. We learnt about exoplanets, astrophysics and generated ML algorithm to find Earth similarity index of these exoplanets based on transit data and classifying habitable ones from them.</description>

      <description>The project aimed to develop a full fledged backtesting engine with multiple risk management measures to ease out the process of backtesting. The QuantWeb backtesting engine also allowed the user to create his/her own strategy using the create your own strategy method. This was achieved with the help of Django.</description>

      <description>The ever-growing demand for secure data transmission necessitates robust encryption protocols across various communication channels. Ethernet, being the backbone of modern networks, is no exception. This project proposes an implementation of an Ethernet encryption system using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) protocol on a Cora Z7 Field-Programmable Gate Array(FPGA).*By implementing AES on the Cora Z7 FPGA, this project aims to achieve significant performance improvements compared to software-based encryption solutions. The inherent parallelism of the FPGA architecture allows for efficientexecution of the AES algorithm, resulting in faster encryption/decryption times and improved overall network throughput.</description>

      <description>This project recreates a downscale working model of Stratolaunch, the one and only operational twin fuselage aircraft in the world which is mainly used for launching rockets into space from high altitudes. The model boasts a total wingspan of 2 meters and basically features two of everything, ranging from fuselage to elevator to landing gears. The fuselages were symmetrically placed, and the Center of gravity was balanced accordingly. A single elevator connects both tails of the model, and each fuselage has a vertical stabilizer, which are controlled in sync.</description>

      <description>The UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Integrator is a versatile and efficient aerial platform, featuring a fuselage of 50x33 cm made from lightweight dapron and a 1.5 m wingspan crafted from polystyrene foam for optimal lift. The 40.5x19 cm elevator and 8.5x22.5x12.5 cm rudder, both made from dapron, ensure precise control and stability. Carbon tubes, 650 mm long and 10 mm thick, connect the wings and elevator, providing robust support. This design balances durability and maneuverability providing a robust and reliable platform suitable for a range of UAV applications</description>

      <description>The project covered foundational concepts of version control, providing a solid understanding of Git and its inner workings. It explored Git objects, HEAD, branching, merging, and commands such as git diff, git status, git log, git add, git commit, git branch, git merge, git remote, git fetch, and git push. The internal workings of these commands were studied, and a custom version control system was implemented in Go, incorporating these commands to enhance understanding of development and project structuring.</description>
